608fa599ce90f81af07caf54 User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:82.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/82.0  Steps to reproduce:  Just updated to 82 (I was using 79, but It happens to me since I update to version 81) and I got a nasty surprise, I modified browser.urlbar.maxRichResults to 20 a long time ago (although I don't know if it is of much use) so far it has always been good for me, in the search bar (I have browser.urlbar.suggest.searches disabled). When I was writing the first letters it showed me pages that I had previously visited, now to do this I have to fill in blank spaces, for example before writing "transl" it showed me"http://translate.google.com"now I have to write "trans " (3 blanks) for you to show me. It's a bit annoying, is it a bug or something that needs to be changed in the configuration? There are also times that even doing this it takes a long time for something to appear, but not always, but until the last update I did not have these problems  My places.sqlite file occupies about 60 megabytes, maybe it is a lot, but I never delete the history due to the way I complete the urls that I visit the most by writing a few letters until it is shown to me automatically (until now)  I have also verified that if I write a url in the bar I have to hit enter twice to load it, while if I copy and paste it with one it is enough  It is the first time that I write here, excuse me if I did not do it in the correct way History in url bar defect Address Bar
608fa599ce90f81af07caf55 Reproducible: random --- It is not consistent, It is very annoying.  Steps To Reproduce:  Open several web page in new tabs i.e, Tab1: about:home Tab2: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/ Tab3: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/ Select all url text of a Tab3 Switch tabs Tab3 -> Tab1 -> Tab3 Switch tabs Tab3 -> Tab2 -> Tab3 Actual Results: Step3: Selection of Address Bar is collapsed randomly. Step4: selection of Address Bar is re-built randomly. It is not consistent, It is very annoying.  Expected Results: Selection should not be collapsed. It should be consistent Selection of Address Bar is collapsed randomly when switching tab defect Address Bar

Lock screen when Firefox has keyboard focus; 2. Unlock screen; 3. Start typing URL in address bar.     Actual results:  Auto-completion of URLs doesn't work after unlocking.  This is similar to bug 521826. However, in this case, autocompletion consistently fails to work after unlocking. (Perhaps the spurious nature of 521826 was due to most people having several apps in the same workspace, and firefox not always being in focus, whereas in my case, with xmonad, firefox always has keyboard focus.)   Expected results:  Auto-completion of URLs works as normal. URL auto-completion stops working after unlocking screen defect Address Bar
