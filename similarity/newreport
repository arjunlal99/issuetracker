608fa599ce90f81af07caf54 User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:82.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/82.0  Steps to reproduce:  Just updated to 82 (I was using 79, but It happens to me since I update to version 81) and I got a nasty surprise, I modified browser.urlbar.maxRichResults to 20 a long time ago (although I don't know if it is of much use) so far it has always been good for me, in the search bar (I have browser.urlbar.suggest.searches disabled). When I was writing the first letters it showed me pages that I had previously visited, now to do this I have to fill in blank spaces, for example before writing "transl" it showed me"http://translate.google.com"now I have to write "trans " (3 blanks) for you to show me. It's a bit annoying, is it a bug or something that needs to be changed in the configuration? There are also times that even doing this it takes a long time for something to appear, but not always, but until the last update I did not have these problems  My places.sqlite file occupies about 60 megabytes, maybe it is a lot, but I never delete the history due to the way I complete the urls that I visit the most by writing a few letters until it is shown to me automatically (until now)  I have also verified that if I write a url in the bar I have to hit enter twice to load it, while if I copy and paste it with one it is enough  It is the first time that I write here, excuse me if I did not do it in the correct way History in url bar defect Address Bar
